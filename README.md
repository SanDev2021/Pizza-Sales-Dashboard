1. Data Collection and Cleaning in Excel:
– Pizza sales performance data was collected in CSV format.
– The data was cleaned by ensuring correct date and time formats.

2. Importing Data into MySQL:
– The cleaned CSV file was imported into a MySQL database named “PIZZA DB.”

3. Executing Queries in MySQL:
– Queries were fired in the MySQL database based on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) provided.

4. Creating Power BI Dashboards:
– Two dashboards were created: “HOME” and “Best/Worst Seller.”

Dashboard Name: Home
– The “HOME” dashboard contained navigation buttons to switch between the two dashboards.
– Top bar filters (dropdown for pizza category and slider for date) were added to allow data filtering.
– Quick insights were included on the left side, providing information on busiest days, busiest times, and sales performance by pizza category and size.
– Cards were used to display key metrics such as Total Revenue, Average Order Value, Total Pizza Sold, Total Orders, and Average Pizza per Order. Measures were created in Power BI for these metrics.
– Bar and Area charts were chosen to represent daily and monthly trends in Total Orders.
– Donut charts were used to show the percentage of sales by pizza category and overall sales.
– A funnel chart was used to visualize total pizza sales by pizza category.

Dashboard Name: Worst and Best Seller Pizza

– Navigation: Accessed via the top-left navigation button. Includes a “Home” button for returning.
– Filters: Utilizes the same filters as the main dashboard for data refinement.
– Quick Insights: Presents swift insights for the Best and Worst 5 pizzas, analyzing revenue, quantity, and total orders.
– Cards: Utilizes cards to display sales information, highlighting key metrics for easy understanding.
– Bar Charts: Employs bar charts to visually depict Top and Bottom 5 pizzas based on revenue, quantity, and total orders.
– Color Gradients: Enhances bar charts using gradient-based colors, differentiating pizza performance.

This dashboard streamlines pizza sales analysis, offering quick insights into best and worst performers. Cards and visually engaging bar charts, enriched with color gradients, aid users in understanding sales trends effectively.

Overall, project process demonstrates a thorough analysis of pizza sales performance, starting from data collection, cleaning, and MySQL querying, and culminating in the creation of insightful Power BI dashboards. This approach allows for better understanding and decision-making based on the sales data.
